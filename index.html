            <h4>How did it all began</h4>
         
           <p> Long long time ago, in a small village of the eastern hungary, near by the ukrainen border. A little boy born as a second children in a low middle class family, in the 1980s,</p>
           <p> later become the middle children in the 1990s.  The story starts as an average of the era in that area, new family tries to find a way </p>
           <p> in life in a small village, father with alcohol problems, mother with an abusive father, low income and so. </p>
           <p> </p>
        </section>

        
        <section>
            <h4>When it starts to be interesting</h4>

            <p> As the boy has memories, the father had work far away already,
            the reason of the low income in local companies 
            could not provide enough to ensure a "good life".</p> 
            <p> The father have found a job in the capital of Hungary,
            Budapest around 300km far away from the village.
            Left to work at sunday afternoon, and get back home at friday evening.</p>
            <p> Compare to the situation in the village, the father's income gave hope, 
            even for a low position, as a truck driver in a road construction company.</p>  
            <p>The mother had a job in the village next door as seamstress.</p>      
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Life in the village</h4>
            <p>The parents decided to live in the mother's home village.</p>
            <p>The mother was 7th of 9 kids, low class family, stay home mother and </p>
            <p>alcholic father how worked as a horse coachman in big city, 100km far away,</p>
            <p>who been at home only from the weekends. </p>
            <p>5 kids have decided to stay in the village, 1 in the parents house, 2 are in </p>
            <p>the same street, and the other 2 are at the other end of the village.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Work after school hours</h4>
            <p>Small village, always things to do around a house, </p>
            <p>and with agriculture soil around it, </p>
            <p>the only local option for work was in that factor.</p> 
            <p>The most popular product the apple was in the village, </p>
            <p>but beside that was some other side smaller options as well,</p>
            <p>as cherry, tomato, cumcummer and brokkoli picking. </p>
            <p>The mother got a new job did work in the apple chest factory, and after school time had to go to help,</p>
            <p>to make the end piece of the chest in 2-3 times a week, and other days the older sibling </p>
            <p>did go to, and who left home, had to do the chores.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h4>The big change</h4>
            <p>A few years later the tobaco showed up on the radar, </p>
            <p>and become really popular in the village and the neighbourhood.</P>
            <p>At the beginning was a small amount, like 900-1000 nmÂ², </p>
            <p>which gave a reasonable profit, and did not take too much time to handle it.</p>
            <p>That grown within a few years into 7 ha, and made a 3 family small business.</p>
            <p>The dads had a main work, and the moms did the main work, and a few kids</p>
            <p>did help out time to time.</p>
            <p>The older sister from the 3 had 2 daughters, and the were the oldest kids as well.</p>
            <p>The oldest had work already, the younger was busy to find a job yet.</p>
            <p>The middle 1 had 3 kids, a girl as a first born, and 2 boys.</p>
            <p>The 3. had a girl and a boy, whom had difficulties during pregnancy.</p>
            <p>For that reason she made clear from the beginning, that she will not</p>
            <p>take her kids to help, because they are more important then the work itself,</p>
            <p>beside that, the parents task to provide to the kids.</p>
            
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>The one who remained</h4>
            <p>The mom and dad favorited the girl, as a first born,</p>
            <p>got all the attention, privileges,the better treatment and</p>
            <p>all the opportunities, positive options. </p>
            <p>The treatment got bigger and bigger between the siblings,and a </p> 
            <p>few years later a brother has born, with a 12 years age gap.</p>
            <p>The boy has stucked at the middle and fall into the</p>
            <p>classic middle child syndrome.</p>
            <p>He felt lost more then ever before.</p>
