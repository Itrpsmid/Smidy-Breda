            <p>The mother had a job in the village next door as seamstress.</p>

            <p>A few years later the tobacco showed up on the radar, 
            and become really popular in the village and the neighborhood.</P>
            <p>At the beginning was a small amount, like 2500-3000 nmÂ²(0.25-0.3ha), 
            which gave a reasonable profit, and did not take too much time to handle it.</p>
            <p>That grown within a few years into 7 ha, and made a 3 family small business.
            The dads had a main work, and the moms did the main work, and a few kids
            did help out time to time.</p>
            <p>The older sister from the 3 had 2 daughters, and the were the oldest kids as well.
            The oldest had work already, the younger was busy to find a job yet.</p>
            <p>The middle 1 had 3 kids, a girl as a first born, and 2 boys.
            The 3. had a girl and a boy, whom had difficulties during pregnancy.</p>
            <p>For that reason she made clear from the beginning, that she will not
            take her kids to help, because they are more important then the work itself,</p>
            <p>beside that, the parents task to provide to the kids.</p>
